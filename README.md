**What I learned by doing this project**
This is my first project in Web Development so obviously it is not perfect. But I really enjoyed doing it. It helped to implement all concept which I had learned in the HTML-Beginner course in the "The Odin Project". I was able to incorporate various practices during the making of an practical project, albeit on a small scale, such as making atomic commits.
