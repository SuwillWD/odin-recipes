    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello. Welcome to the Odin Receipes. I am Suwill Lokhande. 
        This is my first project after I started learning Web 
        Development. Even though this project was meant to be a 
        "get-started" project and is not going to be on my resume.
        I still gave it my all in making this project as beutiful 
        as possible with all the knowledge and resources I had available 
        at the time of making this project. It contains the short meal 
        recipes from all over the internet which I really like. I hope 
        this website was benificial and informative for me. Thank you 
        for visiting.
    </p>
